# ENE-Medical_charges
## Problem Definition

Healthcare costs are rising globally, and insurance companies need accurate models to estimate charges based on client information. This project aims to develop a machine learning model that can predict individual medical insurance charges based on features such as age, BMI, smoking status, number of children, and region. Accurate predictions can help companies in pricing policies fairly and managing risk.

## Objective

* Build an end-to-end MLOps-ready pipeline for predictive maintenance.
* Preprocess raw data including handling of numeric and categorical features.
* Train a robust classifier to predict machine failure.
* Incorporate hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
* Track experiments and metrics systematically using MLflow.
* Containerize the solution using Docker for deployment readiness.

## Model Performance

The RandomForestClassifier was trained on the historical dataset with preprocessing and hyperparameter tuning.All experiments, parameters, and metrics are logged and can be reviewed in the MLflow tracking dashboard.

## Effectiveness of the Model

* The model effectively distinguishes between machines that are likely to  fail and those that are not.
* It can handle both numerical and categorical data seamlessly via preprocessing pipelines.
* Hyperparameter tuning ensures optimal balance between bias and variance.
* Experiment tracking with MLflow enables reproducibility and continuous improvement.
* The modular, container-ready design supports easy deployment and scaling in production environments.
